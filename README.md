# LuxsonicTechnologiesCentrifuge

--AUTHOR--

This project was created by Eric Cannon for a challenge as part of the interview process for Luxsonic Technologies Inc.

--REQUIREMENTS--

This project requires Touch controls to be able to interact with ojects in the scene. (Support for Oculus Go is something I would like to add)

--GOAL--

In front of you will be a table with a centrifuge on the left and two test tubes on the right. You will need to open the lid of the centrifuge by lifting the lip of the lid. You can then pick up each test tube and place one or both of them in the centrifuge. You will need to the close lid before activating the centrifuge. Press the blue button to activate the centrifuge and wait for spinning period to end. Open the lid and remove test tubes containing seperated liquids.
Note: Centrifuge can be ran with both test tubes or only one of them.
