<strong>RMH Test tubes 001.</strong><br>
<br>
A set of 5 test tubes + corks, with wooden stand. Each test tube has a unique texture (cork, glass roughness patterns), and the liquid inside the tube can have its height adjusted by scaling the <strong>Liquid Higher</strong> object along its Z-axis. There are prefabs for each of the individual test tubes, stand + test tubes with corks, and stand + test tubes without corks. The test tube prefab is comprised of: tube, liquid lower, liquid higher, and cork, and each object can be removed for greater customisation.<br><br>

<strong>Important Note: </strong>This asset uses Linear Color Space. To set this up in your scene, in Unity go to <strong>Edit >> Project Settings >> Player </strong>, then in the <strong>Other Settings</strong> section of the Inspector in the <strong>Color Space*</strong> drop-down menu, select <strong>Linear</strong>. Using other Color Space settings tends to make colours look washed-out / flat.
